2bwm
==========
A fast floating WM, with the particularity of having 2 borders, written over
the XCB library and derived from mcwm written by Michael Cardell.  
In 2bWM everything is accessible from the keyboard but a pointing device can be
used for move, resize and raise/lower.  
WARNING: This WM and this repository are experimental, 2bwm is only meant for
advanced users.

Notice that all those WM are really small and that size doesn't really matter
in the end.

Panels / Status bar
===================

2bwm does not come with a bar, or panel. 2bwm will respect the 
`_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK` of windows, and ignore them. So most 
panels should work. The followings were tested and work with 2bwm:

Panels
------

* cairo-dock
* fbpanel
* hpanel
* lxpanel
* tint2
* xfce4-panel

Bars
----

* bar
* dzen2


Installation
============

Archlinux
---------

Available on the AUR:
[2bwm](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/2bwm/)
[2bwm-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/2bwm-git/)

Download and extract the tarball, then

    $ curl -s 'https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/2b/2bwm/2bwm.tar.gz'|tar xzf -
    $ cd 2bwm
    $ ${EDITOR:=vi} config.h
    $ makepkg
    # pacman -U 2bwm-*.pkg.tar.xz

CRUX
----

Available through z3bra's collection
[2bwm-git](http://crux.z3bra.org/ports/2bwm-git/)

    $ httpup sync http://crux.z3bra.org/ports/#2bwm-git 2bwm-git
    $ cd 2bwm-git
    $ ${EDITOR:=vi} config.h
    $ fakeroot pkgmk -d
    # pkgadd 2bwm#*.pkg.tar.gz

Using `pkgsrc`
-------------

Available through the wip ports of yrmt:
[2bwm](https://github.com/yrmt/wip/tree/master/2bwm)

    $ cd ${PKGSRC_ROOT}/wm
    $ curl -s http://pkgsrc.saveosx.org/wip/2bwm.tar.gz | tar xzf -
    $ cd 2bwm
    $ make
    # make install

Also available through pkgsrc-wip


Gentoo/Funtoo
-------------

Here's an ebuild by crshd [2bwm](https://github.com/nixers-projects/UnixHub-Portage/tree/master/x11-wm/2bwm)


OpenBSD
-------

Tweaks you need for 2bwm on OpenBSD: add `/usr/X11R6/include` to search path,
install `gcc-4.7`, use `CC=egcc make`



From sources
------------

In case 2bwm is not packaged for your distribution, you can compile and install
it right from the sources

    $ git clone git://github.com/venam/2bwm.git
    $ cd 2bwm
    $ ${EDITOR:=vi} config.h
    $ make
    # make install


Troubleshooting
===============
Missing dependencies when compiling
-----------------------------------
If you receieve an error when compiling related to `xcb_keysyms`, `xcb_icccm` or `-lxcb-util`, you are missing the dependency `xcb-util` which is required to compile 2bwm.

To install `xcb-util` on Archlinux, use:

	# pacman -S xcb-util

No borders appear when using URxvt
----------------------------------
This might be due to you .Xressources. If you have `URxvt.depth: 32` comment it.

Clickable areas with `bar`
--------------------------

The problem with https://github.com/u-ra/bar got solved by z3bra. Here's the
solution:

    sed -i 's/RELEASE/PRESS/;s/release/press' bar.c

bar from lemonboy has rencently implemented the clickable feature so you'd rather
use this one instead of the one from u-ra.

White java windows
------------------

If you experience problems with java GUI you can refer to
[this](http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Problems_with_Java) most probably doing
`export _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1` will resolve the problem.

Raising hidden windows
----------------------

To show hidden windows you can use the hidden tool:

    hidden -c|xargs 9menu -popup -label Iconics -font "terminus12-10"

Mplayer borders aren't set on startup
-------------------------------------

A simple solution is to always use the video output as gl.<br>
You can set it in your mplayer config `$HOME/.mplayer/config`:

    vo=gl


Preventing X11 Crash
--------------------
To prevent X to crash you can start the X session over your favorite terminal
emulator. Here's an example of a .xinitrc file that will do that:

    2bwm&
    exec urxvt

Recommended Softwares
=====================
2bwm doesn't come with any third party software but it's nice to know what
can help building up a complete working and effective system.

* bar/panel
* program launcher
* notification system
* terminal emulator

Testing
=======

The following features are currently being implemented. Feel free to try and
test them. 

Text based config file
----------------------

### CURRENT STATE ###
Active development

### DESCRIPTION ###
Make 2bwm source a plain text file to customize the application upon starting
it.

### GET IT ###
Checkout the `devel` branch of the repo.

Windows groups
--------------

### CURRENT STATE ###
Require testing

### DESCRIPTION ###
Replaces workspaces by groups with a single keystroke. You can then set the
state of each group independently (shown/hidden) meaning that you can have
multiple groups shown at the same time

Here is a small gif to explain this behavior:

![2bwm groups](http://blog.z3bra.org/img/2014-05-27-groups.gif)

### GET IT ###
Checkout z3bra's 2bwm fork at http://git.z3bra.org/cgit.cgi/2bwm


TODO:
=====

* Toggable sticky workspace per monitor

* Extended Window Manager Hints (EWMH)

  - Use the new xcb-ewmh for the EWMH hints.
     _NET_WM_STATE, _NET_WM_STATE_STICKY,
     _NET_WM_STATE_MAXIMIZED_VERT, 
     _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN

* A separate workspace list for every monitor. (CTRL+NUM)
	* get the cursor position (on which monitor)
	* unmap all window that are only on this monitor
	* map window on the workspace NUM that are on this monitor
	* problem with curws and remapping
	* curws could be associated with the focuswin instead

* Check why the input focus doesn't work well with applications such as macopix
